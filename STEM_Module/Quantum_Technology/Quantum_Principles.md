## **Key Principles of Quantum Mechanics**
### **1. Superposition**
- Particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured.
- Example: Electrons in an atom simultaneously occupying all possible energy levels.

### **2. Entanglement**
- Particles become interconnected, such that the state of one affects the other, regardless of distance.
- Often described as "spooky action at a distance."

### **3. Uncertainty Principle**
- It is impossible to precisely measure both the position and momentum of a particle simultaneously.
- Introduced by Werner Heisenberg.

### **4. Wave-Particle Duality**
- Quantum entities exhibit properties of both particles and waves.
- Demonstrated by experiments like the double-slit experiment.
