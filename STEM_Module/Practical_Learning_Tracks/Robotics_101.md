# **Robotics 101**

## **Introduction**
Robotics combines engineering, computer science, and design to create machines that can perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously. This module introduces the fundamentals of robotics, exploring how robots are built, programmed, and applied across industries.

## **Why Learn Robotics?**
1. **Cross-Disciplinary Knowledge**:
   - Combines principles of mechanics, electronics, and programming.
2. **Future-Ready Skills**:
   - Robotics is driving innovation in industries like healthcare, manufacturing, and space exploration.
3. **Problem-Solving**:
   - Teaches how to design and optimize solutions for complex challenges.

## **Core Components of Robotics**
### **1. Sensors**
- Devices that detect environmental changes (e.g., light, temperature, distance).
- Example: Infrared sensors in autonomous vehicles.

### **2. Actuators**
- Components that move or control the robot, such as motors and servos.
- Example: Servo motors for robotic arms.

### **3. Microcontrollers**
- The brain of the robot that processes data and executes commands.
- Example: Arduino or Raspberry Pi.

### **4. Programming**
- Instructions that tell the robot how to behave.
- Example:
  ```python
  import RPi.GPIO as GPIO

  GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
  GPIO.setup(18, GPIO.OUT)
  GPIO.output(18, True)  # Turn on LED
  ```

## **Applications of Robotics**
1. **Healthcare**:
   - Robotic surgery and patient care systems.
2. **Agriculture**:
   - Autonomous tractors and drones for crop monitoring.
3. **Manufacturing**:
   - Industrial robots for assembly and quality control.
4. **Space Exploration**:
   - Robots like NASAâ€™s Perseverance Rover.

## **Practical Activities**
1. **Assembling a Basic Robot**:
   - Build a robot using a kit or simple components (e.g., motors, sensors, chassis).
2. **Programming Movements**:
   - Write code to control the robot's movements and responses to sensor input.
3. **Obstacle Avoidance**:
   - Program a robot to navigate around obstacles using sensors.

---

## **Discussion Questions**
1. What are the ethical implications of replacing human labor with robots?
2. How can robotics be used to address global challenges like food security or disaster response?
3. What skills are most important for aspiring roboticists to develop?
