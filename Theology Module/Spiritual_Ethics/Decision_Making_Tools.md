## **Key Decision-Making Frameworks**
### **1. The Principle of Intent**
- Evaluate the intention behind your decision:
  - Does it align with faith-based values?
  - Is the intention self-serving or for the greater good?

### **2. The Golden Rule**
- **"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."**
  - Foundational across Abrahamic faiths, this principle ensures empathy and fairness in decision-making.

### **3. Scriptural Reflection**
- Use sacred texts as a guide:
  - **Judaism**: Reflect on the Torah for laws and teachings.
  - **Christianity**: Seek wisdom from parables and teachings of Jesus.
  - **Islam**: Refer to the Quran and Hadith for guidance.
